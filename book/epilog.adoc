Congratulations on completing "Creative DSLs in Kotlin"! Over the course of this book, you have explored the many ways in which Kotlin's language features and design make it an excellent choice for building DSLs. You have learned about the different types of  DSLs, and how Kotlin's language features can be used to create expressive and intuitive APIs.

I hope that this book has provided you with the knowledge and inspiration you need to create your own DSLs in Kotlin, and that you will continue to explore the many possibilities offered by this powerful and expressive language.

Of course, there are certainly many skills and insights that can't be taught by a book, but only be learned through experience and dedication. Creativity, personal style, and the ability to make good design choices are all crucial to the success of any software project, and mastering these skills requires persistence and a willingness to learn and grow. But mastering these skills is very rewarding, and makes writing software so much more enjoyable.

I sincerely hope that this book has been able to convey at least a little of the excitement I had writing DSLs and researching the topic myself, and wish that you will experience the same sense of joy and wonder on your own way. Thank you for joining me on this journey!
