== Modeling State Transitions in DSLs

DSLs often need to model complex state transitions that occur during the execution of the program, or for constructing objects in stages. In this chapter, we will explore three different techniques for modeling such use cases, how to choose the right technique, and how to use these techniques in conjunction with other patterns such as the Builder and Loan pattern.

In order to allow a good comparison between the implementations, we will write a DSL for building SQL queries using the different approaches. As the SQL language is very complex, we have to limit our example to queries using just `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` and `GROUP BY` clauses, and use simple `String` arguments. A show-case for a serious implementation of SQL queries and expressions using builders is the Java library https://www.jooq.org/[jOOQ].

The final DSL will allow to write basic SQL queries like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
val queryAll = select("p.firstName", "p.lastName", "p.income")
    .from("Person", "p")

val queryJoin = select("p.firstName", "p.lastName", "p.income")
    .from("Person", "p")
    .join("Address", "a").on("p.addressId","a.id")
    .where("p.age > 20")
    .and("p.age <= 40")
    .and("a.city = 'London'")

val queryGroupBy = select("min(p.income)", "max(p.income)", "avg(p.income)")
    .from("Person", "p")
    .where("p.age > 20")
    .groupBy("p.income")
----

While this example is using a builder pattern syntax, we will also discuss how a loan pattern implementation of the same functionality could look like.

=== 'Separate Classes' Implementation

The first approach is straight-forward: Every state is represented by a separate class, which is independent of all other classes. While conceptionally very simple, the main drawback of this approach is that all the collected data have to be transferred between the classes representing the states.

==== Case Study: SQL with the Separate Classes approach

Let's start with the SELECT part, which is straightforward:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun select(vararg columns: String) = SelectClause(*columns)

class SelectClause(vararg val columns: String) {

    fun from(tableName: String, alias: String? = null) =
        FromClause(columns.asList(), tableName to alias)
}
----

There is no `build()` method, the only way forward is going into the `FromClause`, which is a bit more involved, as there might be multiple tables joined together:

[source,kotlin]
----
typealias TableJoin = Triple<NameWithAlias, String, String>

data class FromClause(
    val columns: List<String>,
    val tableName: NameWithAlias,
    val joinClauses: List<TableJoin> = emptyList()
) {

    fun join(tableName: String, alias: String? = null) =
        JoinClause(this, tableName to alias)

    fun where(condition: String) =
        WhereClause(columns, tableName, joinClauses, listOf(condition))

    fun build() = build(columns, tableName, joinClauses, emptyList())
}
----

From here, you can go to a `JoinClause`, which mimics the SQL syntax by permitting to write something like `fromClause.join("Address","a").on("p.addressId", "a.id")`. The other exit point is to start a `WhereClause`. Additionally, the `FromClause` has a `build()` method, because the where part is optional.

The `JoinClause` offers just an `on()` method, which leads back to the `FromClause`. Note that when constructing the `JoinClause`, it gets the calling `FromClause` as an argument, which is a neat trick to avoid passing around all the data separately, and allows to employ the power of the `copy()` method:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class JoinClause(val fromClause: FromClause, val tableName: NameWithAlias) {

    fun on(firstColumn: String, secondColumn: String) =
        fromClause.copy(joinClauses =
           fromClause.joinClauses + TableJoin(tableName, firstColumn, secondColumn))
}
----

The `WhereClause` is quite simple, but of course using `String` to represent the different conditions is not very safe and should be avoided in production code. The SQL syntax allows other clauses like `HAVING` and `ORDER BY` after `WHERE`, but for brevity the example stops here, so after all conditions are set, the only thing to do is calling the `build()` method:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class WhereClause(
    val columns: List<String>,
    val tableName: NameWithAlias,
    val joinClauses: List<TableJoin>,
    val conditions: List<String>
) {

    fun and(condition: String) =
        copy(conditions = conditions + condition)

    fun build() =
        build(columns, tableName, joinClauses, conditions)
}
----

The only missing part is the common `build()` method used by `FromClause` and `WhereClause`:

[source,kotlin]
----
private fun build(
    columns: List<String>,
    tableName: NameWithAlias,
    joinClauses: List<TableJoin>,
    conditions: List<String>
): String {

    val sb = StringBuilder()
        .append("SELECT ${columns.joinToString(", ")}")
        .append("\nFROM ")
        .append(nameWithAlias(tableName))

    joinClauses.forEach { (n, c1, c2) ->
        sb.append("\n  JOIN ${nameWithAlias(n)} ON $c1 = $c2")
    }

    if (conditions.isNotEmpty()) {
        sb.append("\nWHERE ${conditions.joinToString("\n  AND ")}")
    }

    sb.append(';')

    return sb.toString()
}

private fun nameWithAlias(name: NameWithAlias) = when (name.second) {
    null -> name.first
    else -> "${name.first} AS ${name.second}"
}
----

In the next section, we will look at an alternative implementation of the same DSL.

=== Chameleon Builder

A chained builder can get quite messy because of all the data being copied around. It would be nice to keep the data all in one class, but what is with all the guarantees a chained builder provides, e.g. that you can't call `build()` or `join()` in a select clause? To achieve this, we first need to translate our former chained builders into interfaces:

[source,kotlin]
----
typealias NameWithAlias = Pair<String, String?>

interface SelectClause {
    fun from(table: String, alias: String? = null): FromClause
}

interface FromClause{
    fun join(tableName: String, alias: String? = null): JoinClause
    fun where(condition: String): WhereClause
    fun build(): String
}

interface JoinClause {
    fun on(firstColumn: String, secondColumn: String): FromClause
}

interface WhereClause {
    fun and(condition: String): WhereClause
    fun build(): String
}
----

Now all left to do is to implement these interfaces in one builder class, and to keep track of the data. Also, we need a method to create this builder, which can be placed in the companion object:

[source,kotlin]
----
typealias TableJoin = Triple<NameWithAlias, String, String>

class QueryBuilder private constructor (val columns: List<String>):
        SelectClause, FromClause, JoinClause, WhereClause {

    var tableName : NameWithAlias = "" to null
    var joinTableName : NameWithAlias = "" to null
    val joinClauses = mutableListOf<TableJoin>()
    val conditions = mutableListOf<String>()

    companion object {
        fun select(vararg columns: String): SelectClause =
            QueryBuilder(columns.asList())
    }

    //SelectClause
    override fun from(table: String, alias: String?): FromClause =
        this.apply { tableName = table to alias }

    //FromClause
    override fun join(table: String, alias: String?): JoinClause =
        this.apply { joinTableName = table to alias }

    override fun where(condition: String): WhereClause =
        this.apply { conditions += condition }

    //JoinClause
    override fun on(firstColumn: String, secondColumn: String): FromClause =
        this.apply { joinClauses += TableJoin(joinTableName, firstColumn, secondColumn) }

    //WhereClause
    override fun and(condition: String): WhereClause =
        this.apply { conditions += condition }

    //FromClause and WhereClause
    override fun build(): String {
        // same as in previous section
    }
}
----

For the compiler, it doesn't matter that you give back the same object over and over again at runtime, because the static type decides which methods can be called, and this static type is never `QueryBuilder`, but instead one of the interfaces for the SQL clauses. Calling the DSL looks like before, and you still can't call methods out of order (without casting).

While the chained builder approach is conceptually simple, it leads to a lot of boilerplate code. The chameleon builder concept might look somewhat strange at first, but results usually in more readable code. However, be aware that this approach is susceptible to name clashes, which occur when the same method signature is used with different return types by multiple interfaces.

=== Conclusion

The Loan Pattern DSL has several advantages over the classic Builder Pattern style, and is very common in Kotlin. It really shines when dealing with nested structures, and allows to integrate other DSL techniques more easily.
