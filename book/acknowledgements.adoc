== Acknowledgements

Contrary to common believe, writing a book is easy, at least if you are passionate. Becoming the person with this passion is the hard thing. That's why I want to thank all the excellent teachers I had in my life, the formal ones at the university, but also colleagues and friends who helped me to understand new concepts, and to develop new skills.

...

And last but not least, I want to thank all the heroes who provide free knowledge and awesome open source tools - like the Kotlin language itself - who make the world a better place.
